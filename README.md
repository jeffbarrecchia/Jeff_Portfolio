# [Project 1: Building Fitness Profiles for Customers](https://github.com/jeffbarrecchia/Fitness_Profile_Project)

This exercise was done with a dataset pulled off of Kaggle. It features several different graphs and modeling
as well as a couple simple linear regression examples to predict how many miles a customer will plan on riding
per week. These are based off of several factors: income, gender, age, and current fitness level the customer
says they are at.
